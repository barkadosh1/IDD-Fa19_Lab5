# Jack in the Box

*A lab report by Bar Kadosh* 

## Laser Cutting

For the laser cutting, I used the provided template as a starting point. Since I wanted my jack in the box to have an animal theme, I also wanted to add etching to my box. To do this, I added in images of animals to the different faces of my box. When actually using the later cut, I made sure to provide the different paramaters for cutting mode and etching mode. I also chose to use a larger scale for my cuts for no particular reason other than thinking it would look better.

## 3D Printing/Creating Jack

For the 3D printing, I also started with the template provited for the servo mount. I used Cura to add the stl file for the servo mount to the program and then adjusted the different printing settings (material, whether to add support or not, thickness of layers, etc.). These decisions are specific to the object being printed and I used my best judgment to print in a way that reduced time and material while still maintaining structural integrity. I then printed the servo mount successfully. 

I also made use of 3D printing for creating the jack. Initially, I designed a simple face/character to use for the jack on the CAD software provided. However, I then decided that I wanted to keep going with my animal theme and that I could find much more impressive designs online. Therefore, I found an already created stl file of a bear's face and printed it in the same way I printed the servo mount. Stl files for both my original jack design and the bear can be foun below.  

## Electronics

The electronics were fairly simple -- I simply connected the servo and a switch to my circuit so that when the switch is pressed, the servo will rotate to open the hinged door. I also then downloaded and reviewed the code/program for opening the jack in the box.
